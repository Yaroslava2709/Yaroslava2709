## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Iaroslava**!

Currently, I am pursuing a Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev (with a full scholarship award from the Department for Education) to improve my coding skills in **Python**, **SQL** and **Django**. Â 

Please see my answers below to find out more about me. 

**(1) Why am I interested in SWE and coding?**

The Software Engineering is one of the most interesting and intellectually challenging subjects. Since high school, I have been really interested in solving different math problems and I always worked hard to get better in math-related fields through my education.  

**(2) What am I most excited about in the SWE space?** 

The SWE requires the application of logic, math, and creativity to solve problems, which makes this field unique and interesting to me. It is a practical sphere that has a positive impact on people's lives. Additionally, I was inspired and impressed by the work of Margaret Hamilton, a female software engineer who served as the director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory. Her team developed the on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo program, which helped land the first humans on the moon.

**(3) What am I working on now in coding?**

I am working on improving my skills in SQLite and databases.

**(4) How to reach me out?**

Please feel free to send me an email on ylegkaya@gmail.com.
