## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Iaroslava**!

Currently, I am pursuing a Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev (with a full scholarship award from the Department for Education) to improve my coding skills in **Python**, **SQL** and **Django**. Â 

Please see my answers below to find out more about me. 

**(1) Why I am interested in SWE and coding?**

The Software Engineering is one of the most interesting and intellectually challenging subjects. Since high school I really liked to solve different math problems and I always worked hard to get better in math-related fields through my education. 

**(2) What I am most excited about in the SWE space?** 

The SWE requires applying logics, maths and creativity to solve every problem and it makes this field unique for me. The SWE is a very practical sphere that affects and changes people's lives for the better. Furthermore, I was inspired and impressed with the work of Margaret Hamilton, female software engineer, who was director of the Software Engineering Division of theÂ MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software forÂ NASA'sÂ Apollo program and landed the first humans to the Moon.Â 

**(3) What I am working on now in coding?**

I am working on improving my skills in SQLite and databases.

**(4) How to reach me out?**

Please feel free to send me an email on ylegkaya@gmail.com.
